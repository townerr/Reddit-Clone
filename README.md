# C# Reddit Clone/Tool

- Project was an assignment from a  .Net course.
- Project was completed with a group member from the class.

- This application is a simulated Reddit clone. It reads premade posts/comments from text files. Users also have a text file that is a mock database that stores informationa and a simple hashed password. You can login and create posts/comments/upvotes/downvotes or you can just browse/search without loging in.
